# Tutorial-9
This repository is created to store information involved in tutorial 9 of ECES450/650 at Drexel University in Spring of 2022.

The tutorial is a kraken2 tutorial, obtained at https://genomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ngs-taxonomic-investigation/index.html

To emulate results in evol1 and visualize similar to taxonomy.krona, follow the inputs (the lines beginning with a $) in Commands.txt

Alternatively, the krona file can be visualized using the contents of the taxonomy.krona.html.files folder

The slides of what was presented are available in Tutorial 9.pptx

The data used to generate all results can be found on the Picotte server at: /ifs/groups/rosenclassGrp/data/mappings
Note that the files are 'evol1.sorted.unmapped.R1.fastq' and 'evol1.sorted.unmapped.R2.fastq', which will need to be gzipped prior
  to executing the steps in this tutorial.
